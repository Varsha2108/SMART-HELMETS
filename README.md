# SMART-HELMETS
It is important for motorcyclists to understand the risks of riding without a helmet. Riders who do not wear helmets are at risk of suffering a traumatic brain injury if they are in an accident. Without protection, the head is vulnerable to a traumatic impact in an accident even when traveling at low speeds.      We all have seen someone losing life in a road accident, and people riding a two-wheeler without a helmet is seen so often, in fact from an article of India today says "4 people die every hour in India because they do not wear a helmet" So I tried to make a "helmet for a life" trying to stop people riding a two-wheeler without a helmet and alert them over SMS whenever they go on two riders to wear a helmet and mask for there safety.
